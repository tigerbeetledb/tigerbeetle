# Concepts

This section is for anyone evaluating TigerBeetle, learning about it, or just curious.  It focuses
on the big picture --- what is the big problem that TigerBeetle solves, why it looks nothing like a
typical SQL database, how double-entry accounting models business transactions.

- [Accounting](./accounting.md) explains our choice of domain model, double-entry
  bookkeeping.
- [OLTP](./oltp.md) goes to the very beginning of databases history to rediscovery transaction processing
- [Safety](./safety.md) examines the gap between typical reliability and what is actually possible
- [Performance](./performance.md) shows that a safe system is _also_ a fast system
