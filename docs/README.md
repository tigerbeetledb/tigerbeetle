This is the documentation for TigerBeetle: the financial transactions database designed for mission
critical safety and performance to power the next 30 years of [OLTP](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/concepts/oltp).

- [Coding](./coding/) shows how to integrate TigerBeetle into your application.
- [Operating](./operating/) covers deployment and ops of a TigerBeetle cluster.
- [Reference](./reference/) is a companion to [Coding](./coding/) meticulously documenting every
  detail.
