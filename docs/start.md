# TigerBeetle Start

TigerBeetle is a distributed, reliable, and fast database for financial accounting. It tracks
financial transactions or anything else that can be expressed as double-entry bookkeeping, accepting
a million transactions per second and guaranteeing durability even in the face of network, machine,
and storage faults. You will learn more about why this is an important and hard problem to solve in
the [Concepts](./concepts/) section, but let's make some real transactions first!

## Instal

TigerBeetle is a single, small, statically liked binary.

You can download a pre-built binary from `tigerbeetle.com`:

```console
curl -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://linux.tigerbeetle.com && unzip tigerbeetle.zip && ./tigerbeetle version
```

MacOS and Windows versions are also available:

```console
# macOS
curl -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://mac.tigerbeetle.com && unzip tigerbeetle.zip && ./tigerbeetle version

# Windows
powershell -command "curl.exe -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://windows.tigerbeetle.com; Expand-Archive tigerbeetle.zip .; .\tigerbeetle version"
```

Building from source is possible and easy, but is not recommended for most users. Refer to the
[internal documentation](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/tree/main/docs/internal) for
compilation instructions.

## Run a Cluster

Typically, TigerBeetle is deployed as a cluster of 6 replicas, which is described in the
[Operating](./operating/) section. But it is also possible to run a single-replica cluster, which of
course doesn't provide high-availability, but is convenient for experimentation. That's what we'll
do here.

First, format a data file:

```console
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 --replica-count=1 --development ./0_0.tigerbeetle
```

A TigerBeetle replica stores everything in a single file (`./0_0.tigerbeetle` in this case).
The `--cluster`, `--replica` and `--replica-count` arguments set the topology of the cluster (a
single replica for this tutorial).

Now, start a replica:

```console
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3000 --development ./0_0.tigerbeetle
```

It will listen on port 3000 for connections from clients. There's intensionally no way to gracefully
shut down a replica, you can `^C` it freely, and the data will be safe as long as the underlying
storage functions correctly. Note that with a real cluster of 6 replicas, the data is safe even if
the storage misbehaves.

## Connecting to a Cluster

Now that the cluster is running, we can connect to it using a client. TigerBeetle already has
clients for several popular programming languages, including Go, NodeJS, and Java, and more are
coming, see the [Coding](./coding) section for details. For this tutorial, we'll keep it simple and
connect to the cluster using the built-in CLI client. In a separate terminal, start a REPL with

```console
$ ./tigerbeetle repl --cluster=0 --addresses=3000
```

The `--addresses` argument is the port the server is listening on. The `--cluster` argument is
required to double-check that the client connects to the correct cluster. While not strictly
necessary, it helps prevent operator errors.

## Issuing Transactions

TigerBeetle comes with a pre-defined database schema --- double-entry bookkeeping. The [Concept]()
section explains why this particular schema, and the [Reference]() documents all the bells and
whistles, but, for the purposes of this tutorial, it is enough to understand that there are accounts
holding `credits` and `debits` balances, and that each transfer moves value between two accounts by
incrementing `credits` on one side and `debits` on the other.

In the REPL, let's create two empty accounts:

```console
> create_accounts id=1 code=10 ledger=700,
                  id=2 code=10 ledger=700;
> lookup_accounts id=1, id=2;
```

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "user_data": "0",
  "ledger": "700",
  "code": "10",
  "flags": [],
  "debits_pending": "0",
  "debits_posted": "0",
  "credits_pending": "0",
  "credits_posted": "0"
}
{
  "id": "2",
  "user_data": "0",
  "ledger": "700",
  "code": "10",
  "flags": "",
  "debits_pending": "0",
  "debits_posted": "0",
  "credits_pending": "0",
  "credits_posted": "0"
}
```

Now, create our first transfer and inspect the state of accounts afterwards:

```console
> create_transfers id=1 debit_account_id=1 credit_account_id=2 amount=10 ledger=700 code=10;
> lookup_accounts id=1, id=2;
```

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "user_data": "0",
  "ledger": "700",
  "code": "10",
  "flags": [],
  "debits_pending": "0",
  "debits_posted": "10",
  "credits_pending": "0",
  "credits_posted": "0"
}
{
  "id": "2",
  "user_data": "0",
  "ledger": "700",
  "code": "10",
  "flags": "",
  "debits_pending": "0",
  "debits_posted": "0",
  "credits_pending": "0",
  "credits_posted": "10"
}
```

Note how the transfer added both to the credits and to the debits. That the sum of debits and
credits stays equal no matter what is a powerful invariant of the double-entry bookkeeping system.

## Conclusion

This is the end of the quick start! You now know how to format a datafile, run a single-replica
TigerBeetle cluster, and run transactions through it. Here's where to go from here:

* [Concepts](./concepts/) explains the "why?" of TigerBeetle, read this to decide if you need to use
  TigerBeetle.
* [Coding](./coding/) gives guidance on developing applications which store accounting data in a
  TigerBeetle cluster.
* [Operating](./operating/) explains how to deploy a TigerBeetle cluster in a highly-available
  manner, with replication enabled.
* [Reference](./reference) meticulously documents every single available feature and flag of the
  underlying data model.
